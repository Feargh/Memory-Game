# Memory-Game
This is game is made from a free code camp tutorial on youtube. 
I followed along to learn more about javascipt. 
I have since changed the style slightly and added pictures of family members so I could send it to them and they could play and enojoy seeing their picture!

I have used other game tutorials to try and figure out how to add a flip effect. This was not easy as the tutorial I used to add a flip effect had hard coded HTML cards. I figure out how to apply it to the elements created with javascript in my code.
