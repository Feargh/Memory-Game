# Memory-Game
This is game originated as a free code camp tutorial I saw on youtube. 
I followed along to learn more about javascipt.
But wanted to make the game my own as I knew my nephew would love to play this game.

## How I made it my own
* I have since changed the style by adding a border white boarder to the blank part of the card using paint.
* Added pictures of family members so I could send it to them and they could play and enojoy seeing their picture!
* I have used other game tutorials to try and figure out how to add a flip effect. This was not easy as the tutorial I used to add a flip effect had hard coded HTML cards. I figure out how to apply it to the elements created with javascript in my code.
* I also used another tutorial to add a start page.
* Created a start page background image with gimp.
* Added an end screen with a button that uses javascript to reload the page.

## Ideas to improve further
* A hint button
* A wildcard that could change gameplay. It could match any card, cause a row or column to flip to give a hint.
* A scorboard
* New themes
